# 🚀 LeetCode 365 – Topic Wise DSA Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode 365 Challenge Repository**, where I solve **1 problem every day** and organize everything **topic-wise** for clean revision, structured learning, and long-term consistency.

This repo contains:

✔ Tested C++ solutions  
✔ Explanation notes  
✔ Problem summaries  
✔ Clean folder structure  
✔ Daily progress

# 🧠 Problem Format

Each problem is stored in a structured folder:

```
topic/
   problem-name/
      ├── solution.cpp  # My C++ solution
      ├── problem.md    # Problem link, title & summary
      └── notes.md      # Approach, logic & complexity
```

Example:

```
arrays/two-sum/
   ├── solution.cpp
   ├── problem.md
   └── notes.md
```

# 🎯 Goal

My goal is to complete:

### 🟩 **365 LeetCode Problems**  
→ Topic Wise  
→ Well Documented  
→ Clean & Professional  

This helps in:

- Strong DSA Foundation  
- Creating a high-quality GitHub portfolio  
- Interview preparation for FAANG/Product Companies  
- Long-term consistency
